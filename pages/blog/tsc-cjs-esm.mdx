## Why?

As a rule, building a library with different module systems is a job for a bundler.

For instance, [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```js
export default [
  {
    input: `./src/index.tsx`,
    output: { dir: `dist/esm`, format: 'esm' },
  },
  {
    input: `./src/index.tsx`,
    output: { dir: `dist/cjs`, format: 'cjs' },
  },
]
```

However, if you write a library with TypeScript you can already achieve bundling with different module systems using only `tsconfig.json` and npm scripts. You don't even need an additional bundler for that.

> **WARNING!** [TypeScript doesn't support browserlist](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/20095) and plugins aren't as common as in Babel.
> If you have a library that requires a specific polyfill or transformation, better pick Babel + TS + Rollup toolchain instead.

## Setup

First, let's do package setup routine:

```shell
mkdir my-cool-component
cd my-cool-component
mkdir src dist
npm init -y
```

After that, install typescript, React and types for it:

```shell
npm i react
npm i -D typescript @types/react
```

## Example component

For simplicity we'll use a counter component as a source for our module.

```tsx
// src/Counter.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = ({ initialCount }: { initialCount: number }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+1</button>
      <p>{count}</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

Save it to `src/Counter.tsx` file.

Then create an `src/index.ts` that re-exports the component. This is optional but better it would be better to do so writing paths to the component will be easier:

```tsx
// src/index.ts

import Counter from './Counter'

export default Counter
```

## TypeScript configuration

The whole idea is using two config files - one for esm - and another one for cjs.

Create a tsconfig (`tsconfig.json`) file for esm, like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "ES6",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react",
    "preserveSymlinks": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist/esm"
  },
  "include": ["./types/**/*", "src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

After that, create a second configuration (cjs.config.json for instance) - to build your library with `require` imports (e.g. cjs):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react",
    "preserveSymlinks": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist/cjs"
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

The only differences between them are different module system and output directory:

| esm                    | cjs                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `"outDir": "dist/esm"` | `"outDir": "dist/cjs"` |
| `"module": "ES6"`      | `"module": "commonjs"` |

Our TypeScript configuration is ready.

## npm scripts

In order to run both complilations in a queue we can use 3 scripts. 2 of them run `tsc` separately and another one runs them both.

It will look something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:esm": "tsc",
  "build:cjs": "tsc -p cjs.tsconfig.json",
  "build": "pnpm run build:esm && pnpm run build:cjs",
  "prepare": "pnpm run build"
}
```

Note that `&&` means if ESM build fails CJS build won't start.

## assigning "main", "module" and "types"

In order for npm to understand how the module works we will need to add those three fields. First field is used for CommonJS. `"module"` is consumed by ESM environment. `"types"` provides type declarations for TypeScript and editors that support types (e.g. VS Code).

Everything gets generated in dist, under two folders as we declared it in tsconfigs. So we just put the paths to files into these fields:

```json
"main": "dist/cjs/index.js",
"esm": "dist/esm/index.js",
"types": "dist/esm/index.d.ts"
```

Also it's a good practise to put `"files"` field in package.json so it becomes easier to import a specific file. This is useful when you have a component library and you don't want to install the dependencies you don't use so you just import that one component.

```json
"files": ["dist"]
```

## trying it out

To build our component in both module systems, simply run `npm run build`. After the build process finishes, you'll get a dist directory with the following structure:

```tree
│
└──── cjs
│   ├── index.d.ts
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── Counter.d.ts
│   ├── Counter.js
│   └── Counter.jsx
└── esm
│   ├── index.d.ts
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── Counter.d.ts
│   ├── Counter.js
│   └── Counter.jsx
```

Let's take a closer look. `tsc` generates 2 outputs: both have typings, JSX and no-JSX files. Bundlers that will use the component will resolve files properly and types will be understood by an editor.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there's no need to use a bundler for building a library in TypeScript. This applies to most cases when you don't have to use a custom polyfill or when you don't need to target specific browser versions.

In case you need browserslist support and custom plugins for compiling JavaScript, pick Babel. It has a good TypeScript integration.

For easier management of all these tools you might also include Rollup to connect Rollup plugins and make a more complex setup.
