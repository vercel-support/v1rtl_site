## Why using Basis

Basis is gpu-oriented super compressed texture codec.

Usually .basis textures are 6x smaller than png ones so it's worth using them in order to reduce load time and size for your THREE.js web apps.

You don't need to worry about browser support - everything is done internally in the loader.

## Installing the CLI

### Building from source

If you scroll down the README you'll see a part of using a CLI tool. You can compile it with `make`.

### Use prebuilt binaries

Go to releases tab and grab the zip folder, and extract the executable where you want to.

### Installing a package

Another way is installing a package.

**Arch Linux / Manjaro**:

```sh
yay -S basis-universal
```

## Generating .basis assets

Then, open your assets folder. They should be JPG, PNG or BMP and all must use sRGB color profile.
Otherwise, CLI will refuse to process files.

If you use a single folder for all textures (as I do) you can loop through the files to get every texture:

```sh
basisu *.png
```

## Loading assets

Now that we have our assets ready, it's time to load them.
As usual, all assets in r3f are loaded through `useLoader`.
For Basis, THREE already has a special loader called `BasisTextureLoader`.

It uses WebAssembly transcoder and a js wrapper about it. It also automatically detects which codec
basis should convert to based on info from `WebGLRenderer` (`gl` in r3f).

We can use a custom react hook for loading Basis and returning a loaded asset.

```js
import { BasisTextureLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/BasisTextureLoader'
import { useLoader, useThree } from 'react-three-fiber'

const useTexture = (path: string) => {
  const { gl } = useThree()

  const asset = useLoader(BasisTextureLoader, path, (loader: BasisTextureLoader) => {
    loader.setTranscoderPath('examples/js/libs/basis/')

    loader.detectSupport(gl)
  })

  return asset
}

export default useTexture
```
