## What?

After weeks of hard work I finally finished my new personal site.
I spent nearly 3 weeks on it because in the beginning I couldn't come up with something unique and not overcomplicated.
I had 3 different versions of the website but decided to stop on the current one, because it is simple, looks unusual and I like it myself.

## Why?

My old site didn't have Safari support because of webp, which I used actively on my site, without any fallbacks.

First, I thought that it isn't worth it to make a new site, I can just simply set the fallbacks up.
But the problem was that the look of the website was awful.
Random images combined with app UI and monospace font made it look like a mess.
I think the problem was that I didn't make the mockup beforehand, but in this time I avoided my mistake.
I was scratching ideas in Figma, until I got what I wanted.

The final result differs from the website a bit but the idea remains the same.
Pure black background, glitchy effects, unusual layouts and so on.
I didn't want to make it fully static but at the same time it should've been simple to navigate.

## Plans for the future

From now on I'll be using this site as a place to write tutorials, tips and anything else I want to write.
I will transfer all my articles from DEV and translate some from [my Telegram channel](https://t.me/we_use_js).
