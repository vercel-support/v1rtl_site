## Intro

Recently, Go 1.12 released. Go now has a great WebAssembly support, even a special UMD script for better DX.

So, if we have WebAssembly, it means that we can access DOM. Go even has a special package for that – `syscall/js`. It basically just gets / sets global objects or calls functions. So, to avoid writing ugly `Call()` & `Get("document")` code, we'll be using [godom](https://github.com/siongui/godom/tree/master/wasm), a library with predefined shortened functions. It is mostly used for [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) (Go to JS compiler), but has WebAssembly support too.

First, you need Go 1.12+. You can install go1.12 from the [website](https://golang.org/dl/) or with [gvm](goexec 'http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.FileServer(http.Dir(".")))'). Second, you need the latest version of your browser to support WebAssembly. While writing this article, I use Mozilla 68.

## Let's code!

### Glue

Let's create glue.js and index.html to make WebAssembly work. Of course, WASM is magic that runs as a native platform, but it still needs some glue to load / display things.

**index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Go frontend app</title>
    <script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
    <script src="glue.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we attached two scripts and added a target container.

Don't forget to copy `wasm_exec` script!

```sh
cp $(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js
```

**glue.js**

```js
const go = new Go()
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
  fetch('app.wasm', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/wasm',
    },
  }),
  go.importObject
).then((result) => go.run(result.instance))
```

In our glue code, we created an instance of a special Go class for better error messages and some setup especially for Go, launched a WebAssembly stream using fetch (e.g. wasm module loads asynchronously), created a new WebAssembly instance, and ran it.

Our frontend setup is done. Let's do some stuff with Go.

### Go Setup

Init go (Go 1.11+) module:

```sh
go mod init
```

Install godom (wasm section):

```sh
go get -u -v github.com/siongui/godom/wasm
```

### Go Code

Write some Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	dom "github.com/siongui/godom/wasm"
)

func main() {
	app := dom.Document.GetElementById("app")
	app.SetInnerHTML(`
	<div>
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>This page is built with Go, GoDOM and WebAssembly</p>
	</div>
	`)
}
```

As you can see here, we selected our `#app` div defined in an HTML file. Then we modify a property called ["InnerHTML"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML). godom doesn't have a function for every DOM interaction but you can still use `syscall/js` "Call".

### Compile Go to WebAssembly

We need to compile all this stuff to make it work. To compile to wasm, we should set architecture to WASM, and OS to JS:

```sh
ARCH=WASM OS=js go build -o app.wasm index.go
```

Nice, we have a compiled file. It will be called "app.wasm".

Now try to open `index.html` file in a browser or run a local server using [goexec](https://github.com/shurcooL/goexec):

```sh
goexec 'http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.FileServer(http.Dir(".")))'
```

We see hello world!

### Interactive DOM

It is already very fun to write webpages with `innerHTML` but let's make some more complex stuff. We will attach a handler to a button and also add content with JS.

First, we import `syscall/js` because godom doesn't have some functions we need:

```go
package main

import (
	dom "github.com/siongui/godom/wasm"
	"syscall/js"
)
```

Then we take our container (`#app`), create two elements – `<span>` and `<button>`.

```go
app := dom.Document.GetElementById("app")
button := dom.Document.CreateElement("button")
text := dom.Document.CreateElement("span")
```

Fine, let's add some text to our button.

```go
// Set button text

button.Set("textContent", "Click on me")
```

Now here all the magic happens. We're gonna make a callback handler for click event. `syscall/js` has a special wrapper for JavaScript functions `js.FuncOf` and `Func` is an interface for `FuncOf`.

```go
// Callback for click event
var cb js.Func
cb = js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
	text.Set("textContent", "Button was clicked")
	return nil
})

// Add event listener to a button
button.Call("addEventListener", "click", cb)
```

We use an array for JS arguments because in JS we pass them as a simple list of things for functions:

```js
// Small example
const args = (...arguments) => console.log(arguments)
args(0, 1, 2)
```

The last thing we need to do is to append our elements to container:

```go
app.Call("appendChild", text)
app.Call("appendChild", button)
```

But there is one small problem...

```none
 wasm_exec.js:378 Uncaught Error: bad callback: Go program has already exited
     at global.Go._resolveCallbackPromise (wasm_exec.js:378)
     at wasm_exec.js:394
     at <anonymous>:1:1
```

Go program is already finished and it skips our callbacks. Let's fix it.

We don't want Go to exit our program so we have to use [channels](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2). We need to put this in the beginning of our main function:

```go
// Create a channel that doesn't let our Go program exit
c := make(chan bool)
```

And in the end we put this:

```go
<-c
```

Now our Go program doesn't exit even with callbacks!

Let's try, it works!

## Conclusion

You can do a lot of funny things related to DOM thanks to WebAssembly. And Go is a good language for building web apps without JS. It is easy, fun and cool.
